## What's the OpenSea Slug?

> The collection slug that is used to link to the collection on OpenSea.
> This value can change by the owner but must be unique across all collection slugs in OpenSea.

Using the OpenSea Slug for a (pixel) art collection
lets you browse online or query the API.

-  `opensea.io/collection/{slug}`
-  `api.opensea.io/api/v1/collection/{slug}?format=json`


Example: opensea_slug: pixel-goblintown

Use

- <https://opensea.io/collection/pixel-goblintown>

to browse online and use

- <https://api.opensea.io/api/v1/collection/pixel-goblintown?format=json>

to query the api for statistics & more.
