    "description": "The CryptoBabyTeddies are the first larger collection besides the main/genesis Collection CryptoTeddies (https://opensea.io/collection/cryptoteddies). They are first and foremost handdrawn pieces of pixel art by the renowned artist numo. It has always been about art first with his collections and this is also true for the CBT. It is hugely inspired by the project CryptoBabyPunks and of course CryptoPunks. The CryptoBabyTeddies are sweet little teddies with different well-known traits. It is on-chain and it is CC0. The CryptoBabyTeddies are part of the whole CryptoTeddies ecosystem and will play a role in future iterations of it.",
