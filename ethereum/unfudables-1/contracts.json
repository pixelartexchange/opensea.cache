    "description": "Unfudables is an ERC721 NFT collection inspired by Unemployables by able.com.\n\nThe Bored Ape character was selected for its market domination while the collection title was chosen to represent the fortitude of the NFT community for its unwillingness to concede defeat regardless of scams, hacks, rugs, and market capitulation.\n\nOriginal BAYC traits were designed in 24 pixel format and programatically composed to generate 7500 unique combinations.\n\nThe collection will mint in sequential order with a maximum of 3 mints allowed per wallet. Metadata and Image are hosted on IPFS and marketplaces are set at 0% royalties.\n\n[Unfudables Twitter](https://twitter.com/CantFudThis)\n\n[by SkullCat](https://twitter.com/TheSkullCat)\nThis project is in no way affiliated with Yuga Labs or Able.com\n\n[Unfudables NFTX vault](https://nftx.io/vault/0x97a495e145fa73fd775fd7975172a74354a59e44/buy/)",
