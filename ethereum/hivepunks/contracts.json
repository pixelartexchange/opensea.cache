    "description": "HivePunks are 10,000 slightly distorted hexagonal inhabitants of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nEach HivePunk is unique and has the exact same traits as their CryptoPunk twin - pseudo-randomly picked at the time of minting. All metadata and images are fully generated and stored on-chain (no IPFS, no secret reveal).\n\nCost to mint is 0.02E + gas (max 10 per transaction). 10% of proceeds donated to GiveDirectly.org in contract.\n\nInspired by Larva Labs (not affiliated).",
