    "description": "\"It's punk to wear a mask!\"\n\nCOVIDPunks are 10,000 parody Punks raising awareness about COVID protocols. Mask up and get vaccinated! We're all in this together. \n\nThe project donated to CARE, a global humanitarian relief fund that aims to save lives and reduce poverty. CARE's current mission includes COVID relief in those places most devastated by the pandemic. \n\nNOTE: This is *not* a Larva Labs project. We love LL and their contribution to this space. They have inspired many, and helped democratize art for the masses.",
